# Text2Speech Editor Project

# Developer : Vaggelis Barbalias

The objective of this project is to develop a simple editor that allows preparing text documents and transforming them to audio. Such an application can be of much help for people who have speaking problem. Moreover, it could be a useful tool for preparing presentations that are automatically played without a physical speaker. The application consists of a graphical user interface, a back-end that enables the text editing process and the part that transforms text to speech, which will be based on external text to speech libraries.
