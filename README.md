# Text2Speech Editor Project
## *Developer : Vaggelis Barbalias*

#### The objective of this project is to develop a simple editor that allows preparing text documents and transforming them to audio.

>Such an application could be a useful tool for preparing presentations that are automatically played without a physical speaker.

The application consists of :
- a graphical user interface
- a back-end that enables the text editing process 
- the part that transforms text to speech, which will be based on external text to speech libraries.
