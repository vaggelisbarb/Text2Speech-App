## About
This project is a desktop application, written entirely in Java.
The main functions of the application are creating and editing documents, as well as converting them to audio.

>Such an application could be a useful tool for preparing presentations that are automatically played without a physical speaker.

The application consists of :
- a graphical user interface
- a back-end that enables the text editing process 
- the part that transforms text to speech, which will be based on external text to speech libraries.
